            Coraline is a girl who moves to an old house called The Pink Palace Apartments in
            Ashland, Oregon, after living her whole life in Pontias, Michigan. Her parents worked
            from home designing a flower catalogue, but they were always busy. Because of this,
            Coraline finds herself bored and alone in her new home. But this would suddenly take an
            unexpected twist.

            In the midst of her loneliness, she discovers a secret door in her home that takes her

            mission to free the captive souls and defeat the Beldam.

            the Pink Palace, decide to take action to prevent the threat of the Beldam from
            returning.

            Coraline was filmed in a 13,000 square-meters warehouse in Hillsboro, Oregon. The stage
            was divided into fifty areas, which housed almost 150 stages. Sets included three
            miniature Victorian mansions, a 12.8 m apple orchard, and a model of Ashland, Oregon,
            which included tiny details like Oregon Shakespeare Festival banners. More than
            twenty-eight animators worked at a time, rehearsing, or filming scenes, producing 90-100
            seconds of finished animation each week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Puppets were used with the remarkable ability to change their facial expressions,
            something that would become an emblem of Laika. Each puppet was meticulously designed
            with removable sections for the top and bottom of the head, allowing for
            interchangeability of these parts. This ingenious technique allowed the film's
            characters to exhibit an astonishing variety of more than 208,000 unique facial
            expressions. This attention to detail in the creation of the puppets greatly contributed
            to the richness of emotions and nuances presented throughout the film.
